            <title>Of Christs testaments, viz: baptisme and the Supper. Written in two bookes. The 1. of holy Baptisme, how it is to be understood in the ground thereof, and why a Christian should be baptised. The 2. of the holy supper of the Lord Christ, what it is, with the benefit and effects of it, and how the same may be worthily participated of. And how these are to be understood, both according to the Old and New Testament. Set forth from the true theosophicall ground, through the three principles of the divine revelation, and presented to the children of God for the information of their understandings. / Written in the yeare of Christ 1624. by Jacob Behm of Old Seidenberg alias Teutonicus Philosophus.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>All which, being underſtood, it will likewiſe appeare what the Ground of the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> of God is, as it is an <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> and how wee ſhall truly perceive what is the Eſſence of all Ordinances as they are ſo called, (which in the ſignification of the word is no more but a thing <hi>ordained</hi> or appointed) and ſo it will be eaſie to finde how far ſhort men are of rightly Eſteeming the <hi>true</hi> Ordinances, and how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they are in taking that for ſuch which is <hi>not indeed</hi> the Ordinance of God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Preaching</hi> of the Word, the <hi>Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Baptiſme, and the <hi>Participation</hi> of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, are Ordinances of God. The <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> or holy people <hi>(two or three met in Chriſts Name)</hi> are a true Church or Congregation of God according to his holy Ordinance.

            <p>But how any thing is a <hi>true Ordinance</hi> of God, and wherein it doth conſiſt, is hardly knowne and little conſidered as it ſhould be, that it might be certainly underſtood, and there is much Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our Minds before wee can goe about to <hi>examine</hi> it rightly; wee muſt <hi>know</hi> God before wee can know his Ordinances, which are of his own appointment, and if we know not <hi>who</hi> he is, how can we know that we love him, and that it is not ſomewhat elſe which we love inſtead of him? for it is ſaid by the Apoſtle <hi>John, He that ſaith he loveth God and hateth his brother, is a lyar and the truth is not in him, for if a man loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeene, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeene, and</hi>

               <hi>paſſed from death to life,</hi> if he <hi>knoweth not</hi> he hath it <hi>in him,</hi> and then how can he either know God or love him? This Love muſt be <hi>in us</hi> if we be the Diſciples of Chriſt; nay there is not any thing mentioned in the <hi>whole</hi> Bible concerning Heaven and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, but we muſt have it <hi>in us</hi> while we are in this life, or elſe we are not Partakers of it; yea God hath ſhed abroad his love <hi>into</hi> our <hi>hearts,</hi> which is <hi>that word of Truth</hi> and life which is <hi>able</hi> to ſave our ſoules, and <hi>doth perfectly</hi> ſave them that<note n="d" place="margin">Yeeld to it in obedience to the dictates to it.</note> receive it (that is, <hi>beleeve</hi>): and it is both ſhed abroad and received by very many ſoules, that neither know what that <hi>word</hi> is, nor how they have <hi>received</hi> it: for example; when any Man is <hi>troubled</hi> at his doing of <hi>Evill,</hi> and is ſorry for it, and wiſheth from his heart he had <hi>not</hi> done it, endeavoureth to have a better <hi>watch</hi> over himſelfe, reſolveth never to doe the ſame <hi>againe,</hi> deſiring ſtrength to be able to <hi>reſiſt</hi> his doing of Evill any more, being <hi>carefull</hi> leaſt evill ſuggeſtions in his minde ſhould allure him, and <hi>entice</hi> him to any evill againe, and conſtantly <hi>walketh</hi> thus circumſpectly in his whole <hi>life</hi> to the <hi>end</hi> of his dayes. This Man hath the Love of God <hi>ſhed</hi> abroad in his heart, and hath <hi>received</hi> it, elſe it could not bring forth ſuch <hi>fruits</hi> of the Spirit: and <hi>he that is</hi> ſo <hi>led by the Spirit is the childe of God:</hi> though it may be ſuch a one doth not know, if you aske him, what Gods Love is,

<pb facs="tcp:111822:6"/>where the fruits of the Spirit are, in that Mans heart the Spirit of God <hi>hath</hi> moved and taught him in his underſtanding: but from that ſmall meaſure of underſtanding, he is not able <hi>preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to apprehend the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of that Spirit, and of thoſe fruits, that is, whence they ſpring, how they are begotten and brought forth, how they grow, &amp;c. nor can they be knowne but by the <hi>ſame</hi> Spirit whoſe fruits they are; he that hath not the fruits of this Spirit, which is <hi>holineſſe, peace, righteouſneſſe, joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> enjoyeth not the kingdome of God, nor till wee have ſought and <hi>found</hi> peace and holineſſe, wee ſhall not ſee God: and except wee be <hi>borne againe</hi> of water and the Holy Spirit, we cannot enter into the kingdom of Heaven, though it be<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>All the Arts and Trades in the world are <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,</hi> and are not truly knowne, but by thoſe that have had <hi>Experience</hi> in them; then how can there be a skilfull Diſpencer of the Myſteries
<pb facs="tcp:111822:7"/>of God, his Ordinances; but by Experience in them; we are able to learne them <hi>all</hi> by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but without that, wee know <hi>nothing</hi> of them, more then the very beaſt: The Devills, that far ſurpaſſe Mortall Men in knowledge, yet <hi>cannot</hi> know the Myſteries of God, becauſe they cannot experiment them, but thoſe of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they <hi>worke,</hi> and therefore know them: and wee are placed in this world, to <hi>work</hi> the works of God, that wee may know, what that Good and acceptable will of God is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ſhould <hi>Work out our ſalvation, with feare and trembling:</hi> by obedience in well-doing; and that will bring us, to feele and know the good Spirit of God, which will teach us the way and courſe, how to finde every thing, if wee ſearch and enquire in that Spirit; threfore let us <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour</hi> after that which is Holy, and wee ſhall feelè what the God of Holineſſe is; and then we ſhall <hi>cleerly</hi> underſtand the Scriptures, and the writings of all other Men, wee ſhall be able to <hi>diſcover</hi> what is true and what is falſe, in all the words and writings of any Man, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly and demonſtratively, to the <hi>convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> of all hearers, both in Divine and Naturall things.</p>
            <p>From theſe Inſtances that have been mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it may be perceived, that all the <hi>Ordinances of God,</hi> have proceeded from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any thing be the Ordinance of God, where the Holy Ghoſt is not, in ſome <hi>meaſure</hi> or other, no man is the Miniſter of the Word of
<pb facs="tcp:111822:8"/>God, any <hi>further,</hi> then he is taught by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and ſpeaketh what he underſtandeth, by the ſame Spirit.

<pb facs="tcp:111822:8"/>from God; neither ſhould any mention thoſe Texts of Scripture which ſpeake of the true Officers of Chriſt, as if the ſame were meant and applyable to thamſelves, and ſo urge them in Sermons, that thoſe hearers that have not abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to diſcerne the truth in things that differ, are made confident to maintaine ſtiffely, that thoſe Scriptures mean them they call Miniſters, as well as it did the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, and other faithfull Teachers in thoſe dayes; and doe alledge thoſe Scriptures in their behalfe, and call them Divines, whereas none of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were ſo named in all the Scripture but <hi>John</hi> the Divine, the beloved Diſciple, and moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime in viſion and Revelation: when as if wee truly examine our ſelves according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wee ſhall finde wee ought rather to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed Enemies of God and of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: But let us preſſe forward in the wayes of Godlineſſe, that wee may be at length ſtrong Men in Chriſt, and enjoy his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances <hi>in</hi> the <hi>Power,</hi> as it was and is, in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and ſoules of all the faithfull holy ones, who have true underſtanding and knowledge in the <hi>Divine</hi> Myſteries by Experience, ſuch were the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and faithfull in all ages.</p>
            <p>No curious workman, can make his ſervant <hi>expert</hi> in his work, except the ſervant doe try and exerciſe himſelfe, and by practiſe attain the skill and readineſſe in his trade by Experience, that he may be able not onely to <hi>direct</hi> how to
<pb facs="tcp:111822:9"/>worke by heareſay, but to ſhew his skill, by his <hi>own doing</hi> the ſame thing himſelfe: The Apoſtles could doe the ſame thing which they taught others, or elſe they could not have <hi>rightly</hi> taught as they did.</p>
            <p>Now hee that conſidereth this Booke, will finde, that the <hi>Authour</hi> knew and writt Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, and that if wee <hi>follow</hi> his doctrine and Experience, wee may attaine, not onely the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of his <hi>Writings,</hi> but be able to ſpeak and write, <hi>all that he underſtood,</hi> and ſo diſcloſe thoſe things plainly and fully, which he had not time nor leave to write otherwiſe then <hi>obſcurely of;</hi> Which when wee have arrived to, wee ſhall <hi>leave</hi> that ſeeking after the moſt deſirable world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, which paſſe away in a Moment; and preſſe after the high Price of the <hi>Calling</hi> of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: now if by my means, any ſhall be <hi>ſtirred up,</hi> to ſtrive, and ſo undoubtedly <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> the bleſſed Crowne of Eternall Life, it will be alſo my <hi>Crowne of rejoycing</hi> in the world to come, though heere I muſt <hi>acknowledge</hi> my ſelfe one of the unworthieſt of the children of Men.</p>

                     <p n="12">12. Otherwiſe there is no true Mouth for ſuch participation. It muſt be a right Earneſt ſincere purpoſe, that muſt put off the Defiled Garment, and be <hi>willing</hi> to paſſe into a New Life. It muſt be <hi>doing, doing,</hi> or it availeth nothing.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. This <hi>Pledge</hi> belongeth onely to Chriſts Children, which ſo heare and keepe the Word in their <hi>Hearts,</hi> that it bring forth fruit. There muſt be Great earneſtneſſe both in the Teacher and Hearer; for if any will handle and impart the Covenant of Chriſt, he muſt <hi>himſelfe</hi> be <hi>capable</hi> of the Covenant and Teſtament. If the Sheepe muſt heare the voyce of Chriſt out of the Mouth of any and follow him, then alſo the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of Chriſt muſt be in that Mans <hi>voyce:</hi> Elſe <hi>he is</hi> but <hi>a Hireling, and the Sheepe heare not Chriſts voyce from his Mouth,</hi> but <hi>onely</hi> the word of Man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. So alſo in like manner, the Hearers Eare ſhould be directed to God in true <hi>Repentance,</hi> that he alſo may heare the voyce of Chriſt: not onely with outward Eares, but with the Eares of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power,</hi> that the Teachers and Hearers power may ſtrike toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Spirit of Chriſt may worke<note n="l" place="margin">

                     <p n="15">15. A Teacher ſhould not teach for the ſake of <hi>wages</hi> onely, but ſhould know and well conſider, that he ſtandeth there in Chriſts ſtead, and that Chriſt will Teach through him, if he be a <hi>right</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. So alſo the Hearers ſhould incline their Eare to that, and Conſider that they ſhould there heare Chriſts voyce, and receive it with great Earneſtneſſe: and not thinke it is enough to Goe into the Church, and there ſit an <hi>houre,</hi> to play the Hypocrite, and <hi>heare a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> and remaine afterwards as before: No, ſuch going to Church and hearing, is no Service of God; It bettereth them not, if in the Sermon or Preaching they have not <hi>heard Chriſt teach</hi> in their hearts:
<pb facs="tcp:111822:12"/>Going to Church maketh none vertuous, unleſſe he heareth in the Church Gods Word workingly in his ſoule.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. So alſo is it with the Sacraments, wee ſhould not thinke it is enough to <hi>Confeſſe</hi> and goe away, as if ſuch a Cuſtome did take away ſinnes without true Repentance, and that he may ſin a new after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; No, it is not ſo, whoſoever is waſhed and afterwards defileth himſelfe with the ſame Mire, he is then as he was before.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Chriſt muſt <hi>Abſolve</hi> thee in thy ſoule with his ſufferings and Death, and Inſpeake or Inſpire his ſatisfaction into thee in thy ſoule, elſe it availeth not. The <hi>Prieſts Mouth</hi> is onely an Outward Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and coworketh in his Spirit: but if he be a <hi>hireling,</hi> he cannot cowork, but yet the Covenant of God in Chriſt Jeſus worketh in the Repentant <hi>Heart,</hi> and abſolveth it.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Loving Brethren, both teacher and hearer, who handle the Covenant of Chriſt, have a care what you doe, there is great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe required, that you be <hi>not Guilty</hi> of the Death of Chriſt: Conſider diligently the Great ſevere Earneſtneſſe of God, how HE hath inſtituted this Covenant with ſo Great hard Paine and Anguiſh through ſo great reproach and ſufferings; It muſt needs be from <hi>a very great</hi> cauſe, that this Teſtament was Ordained with ſuch ſevere Earneſtneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. God requireth of Man againe Earneſtneſſe, to the receiving this Teſtament: Not with cold luke warme Hearts, onely to cover over ſinne with the ſufferings of Chriſt, and Comfort ones ſelfe with it in <hi>Impenitency.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="21">21. It is not a forgiveneſſe from without, which is <hi>imputed</hi> to Man <hi>from without:</hi> No, but through Chriſts Bloud and Death: when the poore ſoule penetrateth into that, then the ſufferings, Dying and Reſurrection, together with the ſatisfaction, in this Teſtamentary Covenant is put on to it <hi>in the Bloud of Chriſt.</hi> This killeth Sinne, Death, and Hell, and leadeth the poore ſoule to the Father, in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. It is not enough for a Man to know that Chriſt dyed for ſinne, and <hi>aſſenteth</hi> to it, and holdeth it for true, and receiveth the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as <hi>a work done:</hi> No, no, there is no ſuch receiving: but the whole Man muſt give it ſelfe thereinto, and muſt will to dye in Chriſts Death to the Evill Naturall own will, as alſo to <hi>wicked Luſts:</hi> and then Chriſt putteth on him his victory and ſatisfaction, and the true heavenly Spirit ſpringeth forth through Chriſts Death in his Reſurrection, as a faire flower out of the wilde Earth, and there is a true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> borne, who is <hi>a branch on the vine Chriſt,</hi> John 15.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. Now there belongeth no great art or skill to this, but onely
<pb facs="tcp:111822:12"/>a childlike <hi>ſimplicity</hi> and <hi>Humility:</hi> the Plowman is as neere it as the Doctor: they muſt all in the ſimplicity of Chriſt enter into humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and come with <hi>the loſt ſonne,</hi> and <hi>the Publicane</hi> in the Temple; there is no other way to it.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. There needs no Great Speculation about it, with what trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med words or behaviour man cometh thereto, but wee muſt come onely with the Children, which <hi>yeeld</hi> to the Father under his <hi>Rodde,</hi> and pray for Grace.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. He who hath learned much, and knoweth how to fit himſelfe for it, is no more acceptable to God, then he that knoweth nothing, but yet with his whole <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>ſoule</hi> in ſorrow for ſinnes turneth to him, and hath Faith in the Grace, and a true Earneſt Purpoſe and <hi>Reſolution</hi> to be a New Creature.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. This Ground, is onely therefore brought forth ſo <hi>deeply,</hi> that every one that ſtrive about it, might ſee the true Inward Ground, and <hi>ceaſe</hi> from ſtrife, and yeeld himſelfe into the ſimplicity and Love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Whereby then ſuddenly the power of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> will be diminiſhed, and People and Nations will ſee that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are the children of God, If they thus walke in Love; which I wiſh from my Heart; for which Cauſe this little Booke is written.</p>

                     <p>Further, it is certain that we may be lead by the ſeverall Expreſſions to the true knowledge of ſome part of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and this great benefit accrues from thence, that it will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to ſpeak &amp; write infallibly, that which hath never been ſpoken or written concerning that Myſtery, be it in Divine or Naturall things.</p>
                     <p>But by the way, this is not to be attained by outward Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Reading onely, but by Experience; Teachers or Hearers that want Experience are indeed <hi>Ordinary</hi> Teachers and Hearers, but not true ones, for ſuch are <hi>Extraordinary</hi> in the account of our times: ſuch hearers are all they that underſtand the Word feelingly, and bring forth fruit, in their lives and Converſations, and have the Power of Godlineſſe, theſe can teach truly from what they know, though in a weake meaſure; but thoſe that are called Ordinary Teachers, that have onely a forme of Godlines, and deny the Power therof, cannot teach at all, nor deſerve ſo much as the Name of an Ordinary Teacher, ſuch a one is not ſo much as a true hearer.

                     <p n="11">11. Therefore all Strife about the <hi>Divine</hi> Myſteries is an unprofitable thing, and is done from without, without God, in ſelfe-perceptibility, where the Senſibility vieweth it ſelfe in Nature in a Creaturely Forme. There is no comprehenſion or true underſtanding or knowledge of God, except the <hi>Image<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>like</hi> Reaſon forſake it ſelfe, and ſinke downe with its owne will into its Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre againe, out of which it is gone forth: viz: into the Eternall Speaking <hi>Word</hi> of God: that it receive that ſpeaking or breathing of God into it ſelfe againe, and through the Divine Science or <hi>skill,</hi> ſpeake in a<note n="f" place="margin">Diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> Separable and ſenſible Forme: that it be a dwelling and <hi>Temple</hi> of God, wherein Gods will worketh, Governeth, and willeth.

                     <p n="12">12. For no <hi>Spirit</hi> knoweth God or his word and will, unleſſe Gods word and will be manifeſted and Stirring in it. Naturall Reaſon without the Light of God ſeeth onely the Naturall Imagelikeneſſe, and goeth on in its own ſpeculation, and frameth in it ſelfe the <hi>Divine Beeing</hi> or Eſſence, as if that were juſt ſuch a thing. From whence is come the Strife amongſt the Learned in Reaſon, ſo that Men ſtrive and diſpute about God, and about his Beeing or Eſſence and Will, where each of them holdeth his Imagination for <hi>Divine,</hi> and will have his own <hi>Image</hi> which he hath framed in the Imagination of his Reaſon, to be honoured for God: whereas yet it is onely a Naturall Image of Reaſon: and thus Men ſtrive all the world over about theſe <hi>Images</hi> of Reaſon.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. But a true Man, who ſtandeth rightly in the Image of God, hath no Strife in <hi>Religion:</hi> For he liveth in his firſt Mother, who hath formed him with Soule, Spirit, and Body, and his whole Subſtance, into an Image: he co-willeth and acteth with her: he is reſigned into her, and yeeldeth his will to her, and ſhe feedeth and <hi>nouriſheth</hi> him: Every property of the true reſigned Man is nouriſhed with its like. As firſt; the Body out of the <hi>Limus</hi> of the Earth, is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed

                     <p n="14">14. Now if it bring not it ſelfe in its own Imagibility and willing into <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> but bringeth its will againe into the Divine Speaking, then it gets its nouriſhment from the Eſſentiall Word of God, viz: from the <hi>Eſſentiall Wiſdome</hi> of God: this is its Nutriment, from whence it alſo reacheth and attaineth <hi>divine</hi> skill: For every Spirit ſeeth no otherwiſe, nor deeper, then onely into its Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall Imagibility; viz: into that Eſſence wherein it worketh, ſo that the ſame hath made it Imagelike through the Imagination: therewith it formeth itſelfe, and in ſuch Eſſence vieweth it ſelfe, and <hi>ſo high</hi> alſo is its knowledge.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Therefore ſaith Chriſt: <hi>Except you turne againe</hi> with your Will and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibility, <hi>and become as a Childe,</hi> which hath no Imagibility in its Imagination, <hi>you ſhall not ſee God.</hi> Alſo <hi>ye muſt be new-borne againe, or elſe ye ſhall not ïnherit the Kingdome of God: That which is borne of fleſh:</hi> viz: of fleſhly Imagelikeneſſe, <hi>that is fleſh</hi> and cannot inherite the Kingdome of God: but that which is formed and <hi>generated ſpiritually</hi> and through the Spirituall Imagination, <hi>that is Spirit,</hi> Joh. 3.6. <hi>For to be ſpiritually minded is Life and Peace: and to be Fleſhly Minded, is Death, and enmity to God,</hi> ſayth S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8.6, 7.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Into what the Spirit of the Will bringeth it ſelfe with its Imagination ſo that it impreſſeth and comprehendeth it, therein alſo it <hi>Imageth</hi> it ſelfe into <hi>Beeing</hi> or Eſſence: For no Spirit can bring any thing to paſſe without Beeing or Eſſence; If the Eternall One were <hi>not Eſſentiall,</hi> all would be nothing: and if that ONE had not a Will, there would be no Deſire, nor Power, nor Word, nor Eſſence.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Indeed we acknowledge that the Will of the Abyſſe hath brought it ſelfe into a Longing and Imagination, of it ſelfe; whence <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Creature</hi> have their Originall; Whence alſo the Naturall Life hath its Originall; which now alſo out of the Partibleneſſe of the Exhaled will, hath its <hi>owne Will</hi> and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to forme and Image it ſelfe according to its longing and <hi>deſire:</hi> As we ſee ſuch changing in Nature, how Nature Imageth it ſelfe into ſo many kindes and Properties: and how thoſe Imaged <hi>Properties,</hi> doe every one deſire their like againe.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Seeing then we underſtand in Man, that he eſpecially above all other Creatures deſireth and longeth after <hi>three</hi> Properties.

Every viſible and Inviſible Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both Spirituall and Corporeall, have taken their Originall in the Exhalation of the Divine Power, and are a<note n="d" place="margin">

For the Beginning of every Beeing is nothing elſe, but an <hi>Imagination</hi> of the <hi>out-flown will</hi> of God, which hath brought it ſelfe into Seperability, formedneſſe, and Imagelikeneſſe; wherein lyeth the whole Creation: And <hi>every life</hi> doth conſiſt in its re-exhalation and<note n="e" place="margin">Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance or Antitype.</note> Reflection in the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>Seeing then that the Humane Life is an out-flowing and Reflection of the Divine Power, underſtanding, and skill, therefore the ſame ought to continue in its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, or elſe it <hi>looſeth</hi> the <hi>divine</hi> knowledge, Power and skill, and with ſelfe-ſpeculation bringeth it ſelfe into <hi>Centres</hi> of its owne, and Strange Imaging, wherewith its <hi>Originall</hi> becometh darkned and ſtrange.</p>
                     <p>As is to be knowne by <hi>Erroneous Reaſon,</hi> which ever teacheth concerning GOD, and yet hath no true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: alſo it never cometh to reſt whiles it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth on in Strange Imaging.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſay I, that this is the onely <hi>cauſe</hi> that Men Diſpute and Strive about God, his Word, Eſſence or Beeing and Will; that the <hi>underſtanding</hi> of Man hath broken it ſelfe off from its <hi>Originall,</hi> and now runneth on in meere ſelf-will, thoughts, and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in its own Luſt to ſelf-iſhneſſe, and Imagineth to it ſelfe another Ground to the Divine Willing, wherein yet there is no <hi>true</hi> knowledge, nor can be, ſo long till the <hi>Life</hi> returneth into its <hi>Originall,</hi> viz. into the Divine out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing and will.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111822:16"/>forth through the life, in that kinde and manner as in the <hi>Beginning</hi> it did flow forth from the divine Power and skill.</p>
                     <p>As Chriſt hath taught us, when he ſayth; <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe ye be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and become as a childe, ye ſhall not come into the kingdom of God.</hi> That is, that the life turne it ſelfe againe into God out of whom it is proceeded, and forſake all its owne Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and <hi>Luſt,</hi> and ſo it cometh to the Divine <hi>Viſion</hi> againe.</p>
                     <p>All Strife about the <hi>Divine</hi> Will and Beeing or Eſſence, whereby men deſpiſe one another, cometh from ſelfe <hi>Imagelikeneſſe,</hi> that one Man comprehendeth the Image of another, viz: his <hi>thoughts,</hi> and yet cannot rightly apprehend them. Where One Man ſets himſelfe in the Thought and Minde of another, and bringeth that which is his owne thereinto, and compelleth that which is anothers into his Meaning, and forcibly ſets himſelfe aloft in the Thoughts and Minde of another, and holdeth them for his proper owne, and will make a ſhew therewith, and therewith domineere in and over the Thoughts and Minde of others: Men muſt worſhip and <hi>reverence</hi> his Thoughts and Minde, and hold them to be the <hi>Word</hi> of God, or<note n="g" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or,</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> the ſpeaking of God.</p>
                     <p>Thus Man deludeth himſelfe, and <hi>Robbeth God of his honour, taketh his Covenant in his Mouth, and yet hateth the Nurture of the Spirit of God,</hi> which therefore reproveth him in his Conſcience, that he is but an Apoſtate Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and will compell others into his Image, that they ſhall hold it for the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>But a true Man, Inclineth himſelfe, to his Originall, and forſaketh all Images, and deſireth no ſelfe Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his <hi>underſtanding,</hi> except what God will frame and ſpeake with and through him: and deſpiſeth <hi>none,</hi>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:111822:17"/>but only diſtinguiſheth the true from the falſe, the Good from the evill, and teacheth the Truth with Divine Powerfull out-flowing and will.</p>
                     <p>All Diſputation concerning Gods Beeing or Eſſence and Will, is performed in the Images of the Senſes or <hi>thoughts</hi> without God: For if any liveth in God, and willeth with God, what <hi>needeth</hi> he diſpute about GOD, who or what GOD is?</p>
                     <p>But that he diſputeth about it, is a ſigne, that he hath never <hi>felt</hi> it at all in his Minde or Senſes, and it is not Given to him that God is in him, and willeth what he will. It is a <hi>certaine</hi> ſigne that he will exalt his owne Meaning and Image above others, and that he <hi>deſireth</hi> the Dominion.</p>
                     <p>Men ſhould friendly <hi>conferre</hi> together, and offer one another their Gifts and Knowledge in <hi>Love, and try things</hi> one with another, <hi>and hold that which is Beſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21.

                     <p>It lyeth in no Mans Perſon, that Men ſhould ſuppoſe, that the Divine Underſtanding muſt come <hi>onely from ſuch</hi> and ſuch: For the Scripture ſaith; <hi>Try all things, and hold that which is Good,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.21.</p>
                     <p>The Touchſtone to this Knowledge, is, Firſt, the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-Stone</hi> Chriſt: that Men ſhould ſee, whether a thing enter out of Love into Love: or whether alone purely the Love of God be ſought and deſired: whether it be done out of Humility or Pride: Secondly, whether it be according to the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> of the Bible: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is it according to the Humane <hi>Heart</hi> and Soule, wherein the <hi>Booke of the Life</hi> of God is incorporated,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111822:18"/>and may very well be <hi>read</hi> by the Children of God: where then the true Minde hath its <hi>Touch-ſtone</hi> in it ſelfe, and can diſtinguiſh all things: If it be ſo that the Holy Ghoſt dwell in the Ground of the Minde, that Man hath Touchſtone enough, <hi>That will leade him into all Truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſts Teſtaments are a ſecret Myſtery, and are prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the <hi>Minds</hi> and Thoughts that are departed from, and come againe to God, where the Life bringeth it ſelfe to God againe, and ſo will the <hi>Thoughts</hi> that returne to God be firſt fed with Divine Power and Underſtanding: the ſame afterwards <hi>kindle</hi> the Life, that it hungreth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God: to which afterwards is given Chriſts Fleſh and Bloud for a<note n="h" place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>falſe</hi> Thought or Minde of Man is nouriſhed againe by its Likeneſſe, viz: from its owne <hi>Conjecture,</hi> or from highneſſe of Minde, or from the Subtilty of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:</hi> and theſe it deſireth to Exalt, and put into an Image: and that Image is a <hi>Branch</hi> on the Tree of <hi>Satan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that Man which is <hi>fed</hi> from the Divine Power and <hi>Spirit</hi> in his Minde and Thoughts, he is Divinely Minded, and <hi>bringeth forth Good things out of his Good Heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that Man who is fed in his Thoughts from the Power and Will of the <hi>Fleſh, he is fleſhly Minded</hi> onely.</p>
                     <p>When Reaſon conſidereth of Chriſts Teſtaments, and thinketh and conſidereth how yet Chriſt can be <hi>preſent</hi> in his Teſtaments, then it thinketh, it is done after an<note n="i" place="margin">Imaginary.</note> 
                        <hi>Image-like</hi> Manner.</p>
                     <p>And when it knoweth that it is not done in an<note n="i" place="margin">Imaginary.</note> Image-like Manner, then it falleth quite from that,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111822:19"/>and thinketh HEE is preſent onely in <hi>Remembrance:</hi> As when his Word is <hi>preached,</hi> then he worketh thus onely in the <hi>ſame</hi> powerfully: and ſo it thinketh alſo concerning his Teſtaments, that Chriſt worketh onely Spiritually <hi>in the Faith:</hi> and that the Teſtaments are <hi>onely</hi> Signes or Symboles, whereby wee ſhould inſtruct our ſelves what he hath done for us, and therewith <hi>onely</hi> declare his Death, and the ſhedding of his Bloud, and ſhould keepe it in lively Remembrance, to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
                     <p>Thus Reaſon underſtandeth nothing at all of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of Chriſt, much leſſe of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> or of his <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:</hi> and in that reſpect Men diſpute and ſtrive about it, and will needs attaine it with the Searching of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: all this attaineth not the true <hi>underſtanding:</hi> For Chriſts Teſtaments are Heavenly, and Reaſon is Earthly &amp; worldly: It ſeeketh Chriſt in the Time [or that which is Temporary] and if it finde him not therein accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Power, then it ſuppoſeth, HEE is preſent only to the<note n="k" place="margin">

                     <p>All Strife cometh from hence, that Men doe not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that Heaven wherein Chriſt <hi>ſitteth at the Right hand of God,</hi> that he is in this world, and that the world ſtandeth in Heaven, and Heaven in the <hi>World,</hi> and are in one another, as Day and Night.</p>
                     <p>The Inward Ground of the Word, out of which the <hi>Foure Elements</hi> are ſprung, is the Heaven, viz. a Spirituall World: In that Inward Power Chriſt Ruleth, true God
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111822:20"/>and Man, through the Outward World: For where Chriſt ſayth; <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18.20. <hi>All Power is given to Mee in Heaven and on Earth:</hi> Alſo; <hi>I am with you alwayes till the End of the World:</hi> Alſo; <hi>Hee ſhall rule over all his Enemies, till all his Enemies are laid under him as a footſtoole,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. This is to be underſtood of his inward Kingdome, where, in the <hi>inward</hi> Power he ruleth over the outward Earthly, and alſo the Helliſh.</p>
                     <p>For the outward World is ſprung out of the inward Spirituall World; viz: out of Light and Darkneſſe; which fabrick, <hi>before</hi> the Office of Chriſt ſtood in the Eternall Creators Office; who from Eternity hath wrought [or effected] light and darkneſſe, viz: the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall World: which <hi>fabrick</hi> is flown forth and become viſible, and brought by God into a Creation, wherein Light and Darkneſſe, viz: Good and Evill, rule one with another: where is underſtood <hi>Hell</hi> and Paine in the flowing forth of the Eternall Darkneſſe, and the <hi>Light</hi> of Nature, in the flowing forth of the Light; and in that where Evill and Good ruleth alike, is underſtood the Kingdome of <hi>Nature,</hi> with hot and cold, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther properties.</p>
                     <p>This Dominion hath God given to the <hi>Office</hi> of Chriſt, that he being both true God and Man, ſhould rule over all the Propriety, and ſelfe-willing of this Kingdome, where Evill and Good rule one in another. As the <hi>Sun</hi> in the viſible World ruleth over Evill and Good, and with its light and power, and all whatſoever it ſelfe is, is preſent <hi>every where,</hi> and penetrates into Every Beeing, and yet in its Image-like for me doth not pluck away to it ſelfe with its Efflux, but wholly <hi>giveth</hi> it ſelfe into Every Beeing, and yet ever remaineth whole, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its Beeing goeth away therewith: Thus alſo it is to be underſtood concerning Chriſts Perſon and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; which ruleth in the Inward Spirituall World viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and in the Outward World Inviſibly, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111822:21"/>penetrateth the <hi>Faithfull</hi> Mans <hi>Soule, Spirit, and Heart.</hi> And as fire gloweth through the Iron, and as the Sun worketh through and through an Hearb, ſo that the Hearb becometh Solar, [or filled with the vertue of the Sunne, and as it were ſo converted by the Sunne that it becometh wholly of the Nature of the Sunne]: ſo Chriſt ruleth in the Reſigned Will, in ſoule and body over all Evill Inclinations, over Satans introduced Luſt, and Generateth the Man to be a new heavenly Creature, and wholly floweth with it ſelfe into him, both as to Divine and humane <hi>power,</hi> ſo that the Faithfull Man becometh a right <hi>branch on his Vine,</hi> in which, God and Man (as to that ſame inward New Birth) dwelleth.</p>
                     <p>Now herein conſiſt the Teſtaments of Chriſt, that Hee offereth himſelfe to the<note n="l" place="margin">

                     <p>So in like manner is the poore fallen Earthly Man, which periſhed in Soule and Body, againe renewed, and wrought out to be a heavenly <hi>fruit;</hi> where in the End, <hi>onely</hi> the Groſsneſſe of the fleſh falleth from him, and the Spirit together with the Soule remaineth in Chriſt: and alſo heere in this Life according to this indwelling power, <hi>dwelleth in Heaven;</hi> concerning which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>Our Converſation is in Heaven,</hi> Phil. 3.20. But the Body is in the World; and of the Worlds Eſſence: And now as the Heaven penetrateth the World, and giveth it Vertue and Power: ſo alſo Chriſt throughly penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the outward Man with his inward ruling power, and <hi>reſiſteth</hi> the vaine Luſt of the Earthly Nature.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſay I; <hi>none</hi> underſtand any thing of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God worke it in his Minde and<note n="n" place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Anſwer: The Matter was not about forgiveneſſe: The Soule wanted not <hi>onely</hi> forgiveneſſe, but a <hi>New-Birth.</hi> It had brought it ſelfe into owne-will, and quite broken it ſelfe off from Gods will, whence the Eternall Darkneſſe exiſted in it: For the ſource of its Life, viz: its own <hi>Seperator</hi> (underſtand the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of its Creaturely Moving and Life) had lift up it ſelfe, and the properties
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:111822:24"/>of Life were quite gone forth from their <hi>Temperature,</hi> and had brought themſelves into a ſtrange burning fire, viz: into an anguiſhing heat and cold, into Eternall hunger and thirſt, into Horror and <hi>Deſpaire:</hi> Where, in the Life of the Body and of the Soule, all properties were <hi>againſt</hi> one another, and Man ſtood in an Eternall <hi>dying</hi> ſource: Hee was become quite Blinde and Dead as to God: and the more he moved himſelfe in his owne ability to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend God, the greater was his anxious ſource: For the poore Soule was by <hi>Luſt</hi> gone into Earthlineſſe: wherein Satan and the Spirit of Errour had captivated it, and made it wholly <hi>Monſtrous:</hi> And now the More it ſought Reſt therein, the greater was its Paine.</p>
                     <p>And this now is that which God ſaid to <hi>Adam: The Day when thou ſhalt Eate of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evill, thou ſhalt die the Death,</hi> Gen. 2.17.</p>
                     <p>Thus the poore Soule is <hi>poyſoned</hi> through falſe Imagination, and through its owne<note n="q" place="margin">Impreſſion.</note> compreſſion of its deſire, is come to be ſuch a hungry fire-ſource, which is onely a <hi>ſhutting in</hi> of the true Life, and a Ground of Darkneſſe, a ſource of Enmity and Contrariety, wherein there is no more any true <hi>Divine Ens,</hi> wherein the Life might bring it ſelfe into Light.</p>
                     <p>As a hard Stone is ſhut up, ſo alſo the Soule was ſhut up, and out of its Good Life there became an Evill Life: as out of <hi>Angells</hi> there became <hi>Devills,</hi> which now alſo are of ſuch a Horrible poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſtincking fire-ſource in their Eſſence, and <hi>cannot</hi> attaine the kindling of the Light, and are an Enemy of all Love and Truth.</p>
                     <p>This Compreſſed blinde Soule-ſubſtance, and <hi>periſhed</hi> as to God, the Great Love of God, came againe to helpe inſtantly after that Fall, and ſpake it ſelfe in againe into the <hi>Centre</hi> of the Life, as a new Covenant, viz: into the ſource of Meekneſſe which it had, which Love-ſource in it was no more Moveable.</p>
                     <p>And did ſet into the Humane periſhed heavenly Ens, his new Grace-Covenant, viz: the Deſtroyer of the Serpent; that God would in the fullneſſe of Time in this inſpoken voyce of <hi>Grace</hi> introduce thereinto, and manifeſt therein his living <hi>Ens,</hi>

                     <p>This Image, Type, or Figure, they ſet before them with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices [looking] upon the future fulfilling, and introduced their Faith, with the inſpoken Grace of <hi>the Womans-ſeede</hi> and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent-Deſtroyer, that ſo their <hi>Faith</hi> might thus Forme or Mould it ſelfe in the Figure of Chriſt, that the Spirit of their will, might ſtand in the figure and Image of Chriſt, that their Faith might Work in that incorporated Grace.</p>

                     <p>For without Subſtance no working can be: therefore they Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or typified to themſelves the <hi>Regeneration</hi> with the Sacrifices by fire, and formed or Imaged in them the Serpent-Deſtroyer in the <hi>fire;</hi> [typifying] how HEE would change Gods Wrath-fire in the Soule into a Light and Love-fire; and how the Enmity would <hi>ſever</hi> it ſelfe from the Soule; and how the Soule ſhould through Chriſts Death, (in which the Love of God would Give up it ſelfe into this Wrath-fire) be changed into an Angell.</p>
                     <p>By this Immodeled Image or Type, with their deſire and Earneſt prayer they preſſed through the Sacrifice to God; and Gods Word with the Grace had thus alſo with the Covenant Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it ſelfe in Men: and now there was a Conjunction between God and Man, for the Humane deſire went with this Image through the Sacrifice in the Holy fire into God, and Gods Love-deſire went into this Image of the Serpent-Deſtroyer: For God kindled the Sacrifice with the Holy Fire.</p>
                     <p>And it was not a Common fire that they had in their Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, though they uſed wood and Sacrifices thereto: yet their fire was not from a ſtone and a ſteele, but from the higheſt Tincture of the Paradiſicall ground, from whence the fire of Life is ſprung: If Man could underſtand it, and did not ſo runne on in blindneſſe, it were well for him, and he <hi>were</hi> delivered from Babell and Fables.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This</hi> holy Fire conſumed their Sacrifices through Gods Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and kindling: and there the humane introduced Will, which hangeth to Earthlineſſe is clenſed and in the holy Fire purged, and ranſomed from ſinne, upon the future fullfilling.

                     <p>Thus ſtood the figure in their Sacrifices [to ſhew] how the earthly Image of Man ſhould be preſerved in the fire of God, and how the <hi>groſſeneſſe</hi> of the Elements ſhould be conſumed, and out of the Conſuming of the fire ſhould goe forth the right true created pure bright ſpirituall Image in <hi>Adam,</hi> which in the fire of Gods Wrath through this holy fire of the Great Love ſhould be brought into <hi>Clarity:</hi> In which New Image, the Great fiery Love would it ſelfe be the fire of Life, that it might <hi>no more</hi> Imagine falſhood.</p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:111822:27"/>
                     <p>With this Faith the firſt Men <hi>before</hi> Chriſts time, (before Chriſt manifeſted himſelfe in this incorporated Grace Covenant, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Man) were apprehended and <hi>taken</hi> into the Living Word of God, viz: into the Grace, wherein their Soule came into Divine Reſt: <hi>Note:</hi> till Chriſt <hi>fullfilled</hi> this Type, and aroſe from Death; and then hee alſo with his life and Subſtance in them, viz: on their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ground of the Heavenly part, which vaniſhed in <hi>Adam;</hi> aroſe, and was manifeſted, and they put on Chriſt in Soule and Spirit: and ſo now wait for their Body out of the <hi>Limus</hi> of the Earth, viz: the Third Principle of the viſible worlds property, viz: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Outſpoken ſubſtantiall word of the Reſurrection at the Laſt Day: As alſo it is thus to be underſtood concerning Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>This Ground of the <hi>Holy Fire</hi> began with <hi>Adam,</hi> with <hi>Abell</hi> and <hi>Caine;</hi> when <hi>Abell</hi> and <hi>Caine</hi> ſacrificed, <hi>God</hi> looked graciouſly on <hi>Abells</hi> ſacrifice, and kindled it with holy Fire, and <hi>the ſweet ſmell went up before the LORD:</hi> for the Image or Type of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Faith ſtood therein, therefore <hi>God</hi> kindled his Sacrifice with the Holy Fire, and it was acceptable before God: for it was a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the Divine deſire; But <hi>Cains</hi> he looked not graciouſly on; for he had not <hi>ſuch</hi> Faith or beleefe, but ſtood in the periſhed Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall Nature of own Luſt and deſire, and had imprinted or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to himſelfe the Kingdome of <hi>this world:</hi> and therefore the Holy Fire would <hi>not</hi> kindle in his Sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cain</hi> ſtood in the Figure of the <hi>periſhed</hi> Adam after the Fall, and <hi>Abell</hi> ſtood in the figure of the New Regeneration: [ſignifying] how Chriſt would with his Sacrifice goe into Death, and die for Man: and ſo the Image of Caine ſtood <hi>neere</hi> [ſignifying] how Chriſt was come to ſeeke the poore falne Man, and with his Sacrifice generate him a New.</p>
                     <p>But as the vanity of Men gat the <hi>upperhand,</hi> and their Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſtill more Evill and ſhamefull, then was quenched this <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> of the Holy Fire among them, till the Flood came upon them and overthrew them: which was a Type of the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> [ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing] how the water of Eternall Life, viz: Gods Subſtantiall Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would drowne and quench that falſe fiery life of the Soule, and how the Soule would grow up out of the Holy Water in the Meekneſſe of God to a <hi>New Life</hi> of Light.</p>
                     <p>Now when the time came that God renewed his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which Hee had eſtabliſhed in Paradiſe: HEE gave him the figure of Chriſt againe<note n="ſ" place="margin">With.</note> in the <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and the Holy

                     <p>The Circumciſion of the Member of the Humane propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation was a figure [ſignifying] How the fleſhly Man of Maſculine and Feminine <hi>ſeede,</hi> ſhould be cut off from the Image Created in <hi>Adam,</hi> through the Death of Chriſt, with the Anger of God: and through the bloud-ſhed of Chriſt be againe brought into the <hi>Eternall</hi> Virginity: therefore muſt the <hi>Maſculine</hi> Perſons be Circumciſed on that ſame Member: to ſignifie the uncleane Birth after a Beaſtiall Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which is a<note n="u" place="margin">Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> vanity in the preſence of God: therefore God ſet his Grace-Govenant in the figure of Chriſt on this Member, and ſo ſet Chriſt before him, whom hee had ſet up for a throne of Grace, <hi>that they might walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and that his anger might not eate them up,</hi> Gen. 17.</p>
                     <p>And he ſets the figure of Chriſt forth with his proceſſe neere upon <hi>Iſaac</hi> [ſignifying] how the Redemption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde ſhould be Effected.

                     </p>
                     <p>But when the time drew neere, that GOD would manifeſt his Love-fire through his Covenant in the Humanity, that the ſame fire ſhould be kindled in the Humane Life, then he brought his <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> [typified] with Circumciſion, into Water-Baptiſme, and with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John began the <hi>Water-Baptiſme.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Anſwer: As is mentioned above: The Soule had ſo much enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it ſelfe with wrath, in its properties, that <hi>thereby</hi> it ſtood in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Death: In it was Gods <hi>Love</hi>-Eſſence no more manifeſt, wherein it might be able to kindle the Holy Fire of God, viz: the Holy Life: therefore God ſent the Holy Baptiſme <hi>before,</hi> and ſet it in the Covenant. For when the Word, viz: the power of the holy Fire, became Man, and revealed it ſelfe in Chriſt, then Chriſt with the holy Fire through the aſſumed humanity <hi>inſpake</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into his fellow Members, according to the Humanity.</p>
                     <p>Now if this Inſpeaking ſhould take Effect, and become <hi>Subſtantiall,</hi> then muſt the Divine<note n="x" place="margin">Eintauchen.</note> Infuſion goe before: for as ſoone as the word manifeſted it ſelfe in the Humanity, then the Meeke Love and Grace
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:111822:30"/>in the Covenant did <hi>flow forth:</hi> with this flowing forth of the Divine Love in the Covenant was the Covenant ſet in the Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: Seeing Man was of an Elementary Earthly kinde, there muſt alſo be an Elementary <hi>Medium</hi> or Meanes for that purpoſe, wherein the flowing forth of the Divine Love in the Covenant might take hold; that a humane Naturall Subſtance might be in the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, whereinto the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>humane</hi> Imagination might Enter, and<note n="y" place="margin">Eintauchen.</note> Infuſe it ſelfe in the humanity for an <hi>Ens</hi> or kindler, wherein the Holy fire might kindle it ſelfe in the dry ſoules fire.</p>
                     <p>As was done by the Circumciſion and in the Sacrifice, where the Beaſtiall <hi>fat</hi> was a Medium, wherein the humane deſire in ſuch kindling with the Covenant went to meete God: and Gods Imagination went thus to meete the Covenant in Man. Thus <hi>ſtood</hi> the Holy Fire oppoſite to the Wrath, and Conſumed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe in the Humane <hi>Will,</hi> that it might pierce to God.</p>
                     <p>By <hi>Moſes</hi> on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> wee ſee this Image alſo, where firſt the Fathers Property in the Fire manifeſted it ſelfe, and required Mans full obedience, to live before God in Holineſſe, and draw neere to him in <hi>purity</hi> through the Sacrifice: If not then would he devoure them in the Curſe through this fire: Which alſo was an Image, Type, or Shadow; [ſignifying] how the humane vanity ſhould and muſt be <hi>purged</hi> through Gods Wrath-fire: But <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not through the fire come to ſalvation and the Love of God, and through <hi>Moſes</hi> goe into the Promiſed Land, but through <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore God brought his Heavenly Subſtance with his Covenant into the Water-Baptiſme, that there
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:111822:31"/>might be a tolerable <hi>Medium,</hi> whereby he might intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his Love-Eſſence into our vaniſhed alſo heavenly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, wherein the Holy fire might <hi>kindle</hi> it ſelfe againe.</p>
                     <p>Even therefore, becauſe the humane Eſſence was become <hi>Earthly;</hi> that Man might beare or endure it: for there muſt be ſuch a <hi>Medium,</hi> wherein the humane Eſſence <hi>can</hi> take hold: for in Gods Holineſſe without a <hi>Medium</hi> it cannot take hold: the will was rent off from it.</p>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>God became Man,</hi> that he might [cauſe to] flow in us his Deity with the humanity, that we might comprehend or take hold of him: alſo that the Divine Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <hi>might</hi> introduce and awaken it ſelfe in Man, and <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke</hi> with the humane [Imagination]: and therefore he aſſumed the humanity, that he might work in us with the Deity through the Humanity.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen God would introduce his Covenant with the Circumciſion into the <hi>Water-Baptiſme,</hi> then the Word of the Inſpoken Grace, wherein the Holy Fire of God was, Firſt, <hi>before hand</hi> became a Man, and aſſumed firſt beforehand the Womans ſeede, as <hi>our ſoule</hi> and humanity, that he <hi>might</hi> baptiſe us with the Living Covenant, which was become a Man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the Body of Man, to which the Baptiſme was <hi>neceſſary,</hi> was out of the Elements: and now if it ſhould be Baptiſed, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant muſt firſt beforehand give it ſelfe into an Elementary <hi>Medium,</hi> as in the Humanity of Chriſt, and Sanctifie that <hi>Medium,</hi> that Man might through this <hi>Medium</hi> be baptiſed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For it was not to be done <hi>onely</hi> for the Heavenly Subſtance of Man, which vaniſhed in Adam: in which the Covenant in Paradiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated it ſelfe, that it <hi>alone</hi> ſhould be baptiſed; No; but alſo for the Soule, and for the Body out of the <hi>Limus</hi> of the Earth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>whole</hi> Man <hi>needed</hi> the Baptiſme: All the Three Principles of all the <hi>Three</hi> worlds in Man muſt be baptiſed: viz: The <hi>firſt</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is the Eternall Nature, viz: the true Soules Life, that came out of the Word of the Inſpeaking, into the Body; The <hi>Second</hi> Principle is the true Eternall Spirit; viz: the Holy Power of the Light and Love (which I call in this little Booke, the heavenly vaniſhed <hi>Ens</hi> and Subſtance in <hi>Adam</hi>) wherein Adam vaniſhed, viz: the Soules will departed out from it; The <hi>Third</hi> Principle is the Aſtrall Animall

                     <p n="5">5. This <hi>Threefold</hi> Man was wholly fallen; for as the Divine Light in the Spirit of the Second Principle went out, he was <hi>quite</hi> blinde as to God, and dead as to Paradiſe; In this muſt a Divine Love-<hi>Ens</hi> be Infuſed againe, in which Love-<hi>Ens,</hi> the Divine fire and Light might againe kindle to a new Life; but if this muſt be done, then muſt the Holy Fire firſt <hi>beforehand</hi> manifeſt it ſelfe with the Covenant in the Threefold Humanity, as in Chriſts Humanity, that Gods Spirit might baptiſe us out of, with, and <hi>through,</hi> this threefold Humanity; that Each Principle in us might be baptized with its like or ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For the Holy Ghoſt Baptizeth through Chriſt to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of Sinnes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Holy Fire of the Divine <hi>Power</hi> in Chriſt Baptiſeth his Temple <hi>in us,</hi> which the Holy fire, viz: the Divine life <hi>in us</hi> would poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe, viz: the vaniſhed <hi>Ens</hi> of the Heavenly worlds Subſtance, the Spirit of <hi>underſtanding,</hi> or of Power, viz: the Second Principle, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Body out of the Angelicall worlds Subſtance, to which Subſtance Chriſt <hi>afterwards</hi> giveth his moſt holy ſpirituall fleſh for food, in which he himſelfe dwelleth: This Divine Love in the Holy fire baptiſeth this Spirit, for it is an <hi>Ens</hi> of the Holy fire, wherein it burneth or liveth: And the firſt Principle, viz: the fiery Soule out of the Divine Science of the ſeperable ſpeaking word, out of the Fathers Property, is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the <hi>fiery Spirit</hi> of the Fathers Property, as with the fire burning Love.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Thus to be underſtood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Soule is of the Fathers Property, and in this Baptiſme with his Infuſion into the Soule, he giveth it to the Son in his Love-fire: The Fathers Property in the fire taketh hold on the Soule, firſt with <hi>the Law of Nature,</hi> with his Strickt Righteouſneſſe, with the Eternall Birth of the fire-Ground: whereby the hard<note n="p" place="margin">Impreſſion.</note> Compreſſed Dead Soule in that Infuſion of the fire is moveable, and its hard<note n="p" place="margin">Impreſſion.</note> Compreſſion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:111822:34"/>of the <hi>falſe</hi> Magnetick Deſire is broken in ſunder and opened, in that manner, as a Man ſtrikes up fire.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Thus now the Divine Light of the Great Love is in the Opened Name JESUS out of JEHOVA in the <hi>Centre</hi> of the Fathers fire: When the Fathers fire, unlocketh the fiery Soule, then the light of the Divine Love <hi>can</hi> ſhine into it, and Introduce the Love <hi>Ens</hi> into it: for ſo ſoone as the Wrath-fire unlocketh the Soule; <hi>iuſtantly</hi> it receiveth the Love-fire of the Sonne, and goeth into it; as fire Gloweth through Iron, or as a <hi>Tincture</hi> penetrateth Metrall.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And thus is the Soule <hi>given</hi> from the Father <hi>to the Sonne,</hi> and thus <hi>the Sonne Giveth it</hi> the Love-fire, viz the <hi>Eternall Life:</hi> for if the Fathers Property did not move together in the ſhut up Soule, then the Soule would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in its Impreſſion in Eternall Death, and the Light <hi>could not</hi> be manifeſted in it.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The<note n="q" place="margin">Commotion or Contrition.</note> ſhrill ſounding and kindling of the Fathers fire, is the fountains of humane <hi>Repentance,</hi> where man trembleth before ſinne; for in the fire-glance is the falſe compreſſed vanity of <hi>ſinnes</hi> in the Darkneſſe of the Soule, Manifeſt, and the Love-ſhining in, of the Sonne, is the Meeke Love-Oyle, that uniteth and tempereth the <hi>Contrition</hi> or ſhrill ſounding, againe.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. For <hi>the Sonne is in the Father, and the Father in the Sonne,</hi> and they baptiſe together, The Father with fire, and the Sonne with Light: after that manner as fire is ſtruck, ſo that the meeke Light-Glance is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen God would introduce his Covenant with the <hi>Water</hi> Baptiſme into the humanity, then was the inſpoken Grace-word of the holy fire of God, viz: the fiery Love; Firſt <hi>beforehand</hi> become Man, and tooke firſt beforehand the Womans ſeede on him, viz: <hi>our ſoule,</hi> ſpirit and whole humanity, that he <hi>might</hi> Baptiſe us with the living Covenant, which was God and Man.</p>
                     <p>For the Body of Man, to which the Baptiſme was <hi>neceſſary,</hi> was out of the Elements: and now if it ſhould be baptiſed, the Covenant Would firſt beforehand give it ſelfe into an Elementary <hi>Medium,</hi> as in the humanity of Chriſt, and ſanctifie the <hi>ſame,</hi> that Man might through this <hi>Medium</hi> be baptiſed.</p>
                     <p>For it was not to be done <hi>alone,</hi> for the heavenly Subſtance which vaniſhed in Paradiſe; in which Subſtance, as in the moſt inward Ground of the humanity, the Covenant in Paradiſe incorporated it ſelfe; that the ſame Ground <hi>alone</hi> ſhould be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed: No; but alſo for the Soule, and for the Body out of the <hi>Limus</hi> of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>whole</hi> Man <hi>needeth</hi> the Baptiſme: All the Three Principles, viz: all the <hi>Three</hi> worlds Properties in Man muſt be baptiſed: The <hi>firſt</hi> Principle is the Eternall Nature, The <hi>Myſterium Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> the Great Myſtery, out of which the viſible world is ſprung forth, a ground of the true Eternall Soule which through Gods inbreathing came into the Body: The <hi>ſecond</hi> Principle is the true Eternall Spirit, viz: the Holy Lights-Power (which Power I call in this little Booke, the heavenly <hi>Ens</hi> or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance vaniſhed in <hi>Adam</hi>) which vaniſhed in Adam with the Fall, as the Soules-will departed out there-from into Earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Threefold</hi> Man was wholly fallen; for as ſoone as the Light in the Spirit of the Second Principle, went out, he was <hi>quite</hi> blinde as to God, and dead as to Paradiſe, in this muſt a Divine Love <hi>Ens</hi> be Infuſed or imprinted againe, wherein the Divine fire and Light might kindle it ſelfe to a new Life: and therefore the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fire of <hi>the Great Love of God</hi> in the Covenant muſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it ſelfe in the Humanity of Chriſt, that Gods Spirit might Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe us out of, with, and <hi>through,</hi> this Threefold Humanity; that Each Principle in us might be baptiſed with its like or ſimilitude: <hi>For the Holy Ghoſt Baptiſeth through Chriſt, to the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer:</hi> Gods holy Fire of the Divine Love <hi>power</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus baptiſeth his Temple <hi>in us,</hi> which the holy fire Life, viz: Gods Spirit will poſſeſſe, viz: the vaniſhed <hi>Ens</hi> of the Heavenly worlds Subſtance, the Spirit of power and <hi>underſtanding</hi> the ſecond Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Angelicall Ground: to which Ground Chriſt <hi>afterwards</hi> giveth his holy Spirituall fleſh for food, wherein the true<note n="b" place="margin">Owne very Reflect I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</note> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Image of God doth Conſiſt: The Divine Love and ſweetnes in the holy fire, baptiſeth this Spirit, for it is an <hi>Ens</hi> of the holy fire, wherin it burneth or liveth: And the firſt Principle, viz: the fiery Soule out of the Divine Science of the Seperable Eternall-Speaking word out of the Fathers fiery Subſtance is baptiſed with the <hi>fiery Spirit</hi> of the Fathers Property, as with the fire-burning Love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Soule is of the Fathers Property, according to the fiery omnipotency, and in this Baptiſme, in which the Father cobaptiſeth, <hi>Hee giveth it to the Sonne</hi> in his Love-fire: under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Soule is of the Fathers fire, become a wrath-fire: This wrath-fire with his Infuſion he giveth to his fire-burning-Love: The Fathers Property in the fire, taketh hold on the Soule, firſt with <hi>the Law of Nature,</hi> as with his ſtrickt righteouſneſſe of the Eternall Birth of the fire-ground: whereby the hard<note n="c" place="margin">Impreſſed.</note> Compreſſed dead Soule in that ſame<note n="d" place="margin">Eintauchen</note> Infuſion of the fire of the Divine life, is moveable, and its hard<note n="c" place="margin">Impreſſed.</note> Compreſſion of the <hi>falſe</hi> Magnetick deſire is broken in ſunder and opened, in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:111822:34"/>as a Man ſtrikes up fire: thus a new fire of God is kindled, which<note n="e" place="margin">Trembling or Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Commotion, or ſhrill ſounding, is alſo the Ground of Repentance.</p>
                     <p>Now when the Fathers fire is ſtirred and kindled, then ſhineth the Divine Light of the Great ſweet Love in the opened Name JESUS out of the Holy Name JEHOVA in the <hi>Centre</hi> of the Fathers fire, out of the unity of God, as the Beames of Divine Grace in the Soule: for the Soule is with this Glimps unlocked, and then <hi>ſuddenly</hi> the Light of Love taketh in the unlooked ground, &amp; filleth it with the ſubſtance of Love.</p>
                     <p>And thus the Sonne, viz: the Love of the Father, receiveth the Soule, and ſanctifieth it, and throughly penetrateth it; as fire throughly penetrateth the Iron. And that is it which Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Father the Men were thine, and thou haſt given them unto mee: and I give them the Eternall Life:</hi> Alſo:<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                        <hi>This is the Eternall Life, that they rightly know thee Father, that thou art the true God, and whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 17.3.6.</p>
                     <p>In this inſhining and indwelling Light, is the New Birth, and God is Comprehended and knowne in the Spirit: whereupon followeth inſtantly <hi>the true Faith,</hi> which willeth nothing but what God will; for thus is Chriſt <hi>the Light of the</hi> Little <hi>World,</hi> viz: of <hi>Man,</hi> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Eternall Light-Life of God, to the Soule.</p>
                     <p>And thus the Soule liveth in the Father, and yet with the Sonnes office is governed and ſanctified, and its anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fire-Life is a meere Love-burning: But the Fathers <hi>Concuſſion</hi> or ſhrill ſounding is neceſſary, that the ſoules fire-ſource may be touched, that the Soule may finde what it is: for it is thereby brought into continuall <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and humility, when the Beame of Gods wrath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten toucheth it, that it conſider its fall, and is at <hi>no time ſecure:</hi> (for it hath a great Enemy <hi>neere it</hi> in its fleſh and bloud, viz: Satans poyſon) that it may no more run-on in its owne will as formerly: For the Soule in this Beame of wrath trembleth before <hi>ſinne,</hi> and ſo ſinne is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:111822:35"/>manifeſted in the Light: and then comes Sorrow and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation over ſinne on a heape. And thus ſtandeth this pretious figure in the Inward Ground. For where the owne will of ſinne is <hi>ſhaken</hi> through Repentance, there the holy anointing Oyle of Love penetrateth inſtantly and healeth theſe wounds. Thus the Father Baptiſeth with fire to Repentance, and the Sonne with Love, to <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt manageth the office, who bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſeth with a New life: For the whole holy <hi>Trinity</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſeth according to the Divine Manifeſtation; For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and beyond the Manifeſtation there is onely One Triune God in one onely Good<note n="f" place="margin">Subſtance or Eſſence.</note> Beeing and Will, whereof a Man <hi>cannot</hi> ſay: the Father is wrath, this or that, but is the Triune Good Beeing: But according to his Manifeſtation, out of which the Soules and Angells, together with Every Heavenly and Helliſh Beeing is ſprung, (viz: after the Manner of the <hi>Myſterium Magnum,</hi> the Great Myſtery;) from hence ariſeth his Wrath or fire-ſource, and that from Eternity in Eternity.</p>
                     <p>Note: Thus now a Man may underſtand the Baptiſme according to the <hi>Inward</hi> Ground, according to Soule and Spirit: viz: the Father Baptiſeth with the Concuſſion or ſhrill ſounding to Repentance with fire. in which fire, the bitter ſuffering and dying of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is impreſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the poore Soule: for the Wrath-fire which holdeth the Soule captive, is overcome and ſoftened with <hi>Love:</hi> and this is impreſſed in the Soule as a <hi>victory:</hi> and the Sonne baptiſeth with the holy anointing-Oyle of Gods Love, and healeth the poore ſhaken Soule againe: And the true Comforter the Holy Ghoſt, which goeth forth through Chriſts Death, through Chriſts Reſurrection, through the Father in the Sonne, he baptiſeth with <hi>a new Life,</hi> and <hi>giveth</hi> true Faith and underſtanding, that wee receive and know this.</p>
                     <p>The Third Property of the Third Principle, with the Water-Baptiſme, wherewith the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>outward</hi> worlds Subſtance, as alſo the Outward Life is baptiſed, that is conſidered as followeth:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:111822:36"/>By the <hi>Water,</hi> viz: by the Element of the body of Chriſt, the Right Adamicall Man <hi>out of the Elements,</hi> which was created in <hi>Adam,</hi> underſtand the outward worlds Subſtance, is <hi>baptiſed:</hi> for heere the Holy Ghoſt Baptiſeth, who goeth forth from the Father and the Sonne, his going forth is the formation of the world, and the world is the outſpoken formed Word, and <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> it is, that hath formed <hi>that outſpoken Word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hee</hi> is to be underſtood in all <hi>Three</hi> Principles or Worlds, in each world according to their property. As Firſt in the Fathers wrath according to the Darkneſſe, Hee is the flame of <hi>painefullneſſe:</hi> and Secondly, in the Eternall Light he is the <hi>Love</hi> flame of God: and Thirdly, in this world <hi>in Spiritu Mundi,</hi> in the Spirit of this world hee is the <hi>formour</hi> and workmaſter of Every thing, in every thing according to its property: as the <hi>Seperator</hi> or <hi>Archaeus</hi> of the thing is, from whence it ariſeth, ſo alſo is the outflowne Spirit out of the outſpoken word, in every thing.</p>
                     <p>And it is <hi>not</hi> to be underſtood, that the Spirit of the Outward Subſtance, <hi>is</hi> called <hi>God,</hi> but it is the outflowne Spirit in the outſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Word of God, which with its <hi>Ground</hi> ſtandeth in the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Outflowne</hi> Spirit of the outward Naturall and Creaturely Life, is flowen forth out of Gods Love and Wrath, out of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> viz: out of the firſt and ſecond Principle, out of the Eternall Nature, out of the <hi>Speaking</hi> of the Word, for the Eternall Word, hath <hi>breathed</hi> it ſelfe with that Spirit into a Creaturely, Image-like Life.</p>
                     <p>It is the Soule of the <hi>Outward</hi> World, a Life of the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Its power is as a fiery and lightiſh <hi>Conſtellation:</hi> What the whole outward Conſtellation is in it ſelfe in its power, the ſame is that [Spirit] every where alone in it ſelfe, yet as a ſhut up Conſtellation that lyeth in the <hi>Temperament,</hi> and yet unfoldeth it ſelfe in every Life, and maketh it ſelfe Seperable, according to every Lifes property.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 His Incarnation or becoming Man, came not from the will of the fleſh, for his Father <hi>Zachary</hi> and Mother <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which were ancient people full of Dayes, who were cleerly dead in the fleſhly ſperme or ſeede, where the ability of Man was cleerly gone: The ſeede of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was raiſed up through the <hi>moving</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt out of the Paradiſicall Grace-Covenant in their now quite vaniſhed Spermatick Property.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Indeed he came out of the humane Ground, but not out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>ability,</hi> for the Anointing in the Covenant awakened it, ſo that their ſperme, above the courſe and power of Natures owne ability was unlocked: which <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> raiſed up a ſeede out of the humane ſperme, and to that purpoſe choſe<note n="a" place="margin">The Seede.</note> it in its firſt beginning.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But the anointing of <hi>John</hi> was done in <hi>Maries</hi> Salute, when ſhee came to old <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the divine anointing ſtirred in her (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in <hi>Mary</hi>) out of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Incarnation or becoming Man: When <hi>Mary</hi> full of this anointing, ſaluted <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> then the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> diffuſed with the anointing through the ſalute of <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>John</hi> in the Mothers womb: and not onely in <hi>John,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in his Mother <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſo that ſhee was full of this anointing, and both the Mothers propheſied in the Spirit of this anointing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And this is the Baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> when as he was anointed with the Incarnation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> out of Chriſt, and received the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of the Holy Ghoſt out of the Covenant in the Mothers womb, ſo that he ſhould be a <hi>Forerunner</hi> and declarer, <hi>that the time</hi> of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing, and fullfilling of the Covenant of God, <hi>was at hand:</hi> that God hath introduced his Covenant of the anointing of Grace, into the humanity, and that the Covenant is become a Man: that God will hence forward ſhed forth his anointing through the humanity of Chriſt, through an Elementary <hi>Medium</hi> or Meanes, (that conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no more in <hi>fire,</hi> as in the Old Teſtament, but in Love and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Water,</hi> ſo that <hi>the time</hi> of Grace <hi>is at hand,</hi> wherein God hath given his anointing into the humanity.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And then wee ſee that God there began no new Covenant, but onely a New <hi>Ordinance:</hi> for <hi>John</hi> ſuffered himſelfe to be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, as alſo <hi>Chriſt: John</hi> tooke the <hi>power</hi> and calling out of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Circumciſion, out of the Sacrifices of fire, and by the command of God brought them into the <hi>Water-Baptiſme:</hi> to ſignifie that hence forward ſinne ſhould be drowned by the death of Chriſt in his Love and Meekneſſe, and <hi>no more</hi> burne in the fire, as was done by <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Type.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Moreover wee ſee by <hi>John,</hi> that he did not yet baptiſe with the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, but with <hi>Repentance,</hi> viz. with the Spirit of the anointing to Repentance, which ſoundeth through the hearts of Men, and <hi>prepareth the way</hi> for the Spirit of Chriſt, which <hi>unlock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Doores</hi> of Mens hearts and ſoules, <hi>that</hi> after<note n="b" place="margin">

                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:111822:39"/>
                  <p n="8">8. Alſo wee ſee in <hi>John,</hi> that he muſt be the ſonne of a Prieſt, who were converſant about Circumciſion and Sacrifices: he muſt come out of the Law of the Covenant, and ſuffer himſelfe to be Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and put on the Covenant, that he might with the Spirit of the Covenant and of Circumciſion, <hi>begin</hi> the Water Baptiſme; viz: the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of Grace and forgiveneſſe: for ſinne ſhould be deſtroyed now no more by fire, but by Love, which God manifeſted in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant through <hi>Chriſt;</hi> it [ſinne] ſhould be drowned and changed by Gods Meekneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="9">9.

                  <p n="16">16. But ſeeing the humane will was departed from God, and had brought it ſelfe into Earthly beaſtiall Luſt: therefore ſhould this Ram, viz: the Humanity of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be kindled with Gods fire of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: for the Anger of God was become manifeſt in the humanity: and therefore God anointed firſt the humanity with <hi>the Spirit</hi> of his Love in Chriſts humanity, and afterwards offered this Ram, viz: the right Adamicall humanity to the fire of God, that in the Anointing of the Love-Oyle, the anger-fire might be kindled, and the anger fire in the anointing of the Love, viz: through the <hi>Oyle</hi> of its holy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, be tranſmuted, and wholly turned into a Love burning.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. For our humane ſoule was become an Anger fire, viz: an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> againſt God, and therefore thus God reconciled it in the Love of its ſubſtance: That is, Gods anger in the humane life was thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, for Gods power ſmelt, or thus drew, in the fire, the humane life againe into the Eternall Word, viz: into God. Gods Anger-fire
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:111822:48"/>was the <hi>Mouth,</hi> which received the humane Life againe into it, and ſwallowed up the humane <hi>averted</hi> will into it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. But when this Great love had given up it ſelfe into the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life in Chriſt, then was Gods Anger-fire with its devouring in the ſoules fire, turned into meere Love, viz: wholly into a Love-fire: and thus <hi>Death</hi> in the fire of Gods Anger, which holdeth the ſoule captive with its Impreſſion: wherein the ſoule was a darkneſſe, viz: a darke fire; <hi>was broake open,</hi> and againe turned into the Light Life.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. And that is it, which God with this Sacrifice ſets forth in a Type, of the Comming of Chriſt: for <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayth: <hi>This was a ſweet ſavour to the Lord:</hi> Now God doth not ſavour the beaſtiall Life; for that ſhall not inherite the Kingdome of God: Gods buiſines which he had to doe by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was not about the Ram and the Heifer, but he ſet forth the humanity under them before him: Gods Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on went into the Humanity in his inſpoken Grace-Covenant, viz: in that inſpoken Grace word of Love, which ſtood as a Goale or Limit in Man, even unto <hi>Mary,</hi> where it manifeſted it ſelfe in the Humanity: Into this went Gods Imagination, and Mans Imagination went into this <hi>Type,</hi> viz: into the Sacrifice in the fire: Thus went alſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated Grace-Covenant with Mans Imagination into the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the fire, as into the <hi>Type</hi> [ſignifying] how Chriſt ſhould recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile Gods anger in the humanity.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And thus was the humane will in the Type of Chriſt ranſomed in the fire; for the Incorporated Grace-Covenant, went with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane deſire, in their <hi>prayer</hi> (which through this Sacrifice in the fire preſſed into God) together into the fire of the Sacrifice, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled (that is, deſtroyed) the Earthly Beaſtiall <hi>property</hi> of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane will, in the fire, with the Love: For with the fire God formed an Image before him, as a ſubſtance, in which fire ſubſtance Gods fire Imaged it ſelfe, and reconciled the Elementary fire in Man: his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Love-fire, <hi>ſavoured</hi> the humane will, through the incorporated Grace, through that <hi>Medium</hi> of the fire, for <hi>Moſes</hi> had holy fire, wherewith he kindled the Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Thus was the Elementary fire of Man reconciled in the Holy Fire, and yet muſt a Beaſtiall <hi>Medium,</hi> viz: Beaſts fleſh, come into the Holy fire of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſeeing Man was become Beaſtiall: that the beaſtiall kinde be burned away in the Holy fire through the Fathers anger-fire; and that Gods Love-fire might kindle the humane ſoule-fire in its introduced deſire in the Sacrifice and ſo Gods deſire in the Word <hi>ſmelt</hi> Mans deſire through the fire; for in the fire, the Beaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vanity of Mans will, burnt away in the anger-fire: and ſo then the cleere humane will, preſſed into Gods Love-fire, as <hi>a ſweet ſavour:</hi> for the incorporated Paradiſicall inſpoken Grace, preſſed with the cleere will of Man, into God.</p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:111822:48"/>
                  <p n="22">22. And that is it which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayth; <hi>It was a ſacrifice of a ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unto the Lord:</hi> For God deſired to ſmell nothing there, but onely Mans will, viz: the humane <hi>Life,</hi> which before the times of the world, was in the Word of God: indeed without Creature, but yet in <hi>power,</hi> which was inbreathed to the Created Image: That ſame did God ſmell through the Sacrifice in the <hi>Ens</hi> of Chriſt viz: through the inſpoken Grace, and reconciled the averted will through the Grace in the Fire, ſo that the humane will became <hi>divine</hi> againe: and brought (1) the humane Lifes fire, and (2) Gods Love fire, into one fire, as into <hi>one</hi> lifes burning: and that was a right Sacrifice of Reconciliation, or ſinne-offering, when ſinne was offered to the fire of Gods anger to be <hi>conſumed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. And thus alſo the beaſtiall <hi>fleſh,</hi> which they offered and eare afterwards, was ſanctified to Man: for Gods Imagination in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant went thereinto; therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> calleth it; <hi>Holy Fleſh:</hi> alſo, <hi>Holy Bread,</hi> ſuch was <hi>the Shew bread,</hi> ſam. 21.6. Matth. 12.4. All which, ſtood in the Type [ſignifying] How that ſame <hi>incorporated</hi> power of the Grace-Covenant, would manifeſt it ſelfe with Heavenly Subſtance in Chriſt, and give it for food of the humane ſoule, viz: to the ſoules fire: in which food, the ſoules-fire ſhould be <hi>turned</hi> into a Love-fire.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. For in the Old Teſtament this ſweet Grace Covenant gave it ſelfe into the Sacrifice of the fiery ſoules deſire, for ſood, as to the Soules Mouth in the fire: For the Soule, viz: the Souliſh Faiths <hi>Mouth,</hi> did in the Sacrifice of fire, eate of this ſweet Grace, <hi>not</hi> in the Subſtance, but in the power, upon the fullfilling that was to come, till the power was manifeſted in the fleſh: But their Body did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, eate of the bleſſed bread and fleſh,<note place="margin">Note.</note> wherein alſo the <hi>power</hi> of the Grace, viz: the Imagination of the Covenant, was. Thus the <hi>Jewes did eate Chriſts fleſh and drank his bloud</hi> in the Grace <hi>Ens,</hi> in the power, in the Type; where the power was not yet fleſh and bloud: but yet that ſame word of Grace, which afterwards became Man, was <hi>therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. But when the time came, and was fulfilled, that the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated Word of Grace (which received their Soule in the faiths-deſire in the fiery Eſſence) <hi>became Man,</hi> then it gave it ſelfe to this faiths Mouth, viz: of the fiery ſouliſh Eſſence, according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane property, for food: Of which wee will heere fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing write more at large, and ſet downe the true Ground, how <hi>Chriſts fleſh and bloud it to be eaten and drunk:</hi> not out of a Conceit or Opinion, but out of the Ground of <hi>the Scripture,</hi> and true certaine knowledge through Gods Grace.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the time was <hi>fullfilled,</hi> that this Grace-Covenant ſhould manifeſt it ſelfe, and aſſume the Humanity with Soule and Body, then the <hi>Type</hi> ceaſed; For the Anger-fire of God in the Soule and in the fleſh of Man, was together<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or,</hi> Immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> imprinted in the Subſtantiall Word, viz: in the Divine <hi>Ens:</hi> which Divine <hi>Ens</hi> out of the Divine power, aſſumed alſo the Divine <hi>Ens</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> which vaniſhed as to the Kingdome of Heaven, viz: to the Holy Working Fire, when the Soule <hi>Imaged</hi> it ſelfe into Earthlineſſe; and made it living, that is burning in it ſelfe againe, through the <hi>Holy</hi> Fire, where then the Divine Sacrifice in the fire was manifeſted in the Humanity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the Soule was of the Fathers property, according to his fires might, and was become a meere fire of <hi>Anger: This the Father gave to the Sonne,</hi> as to the Manifeſted Grace-Covenant, and brought the Fathers Anger-fire in the Soule, into the Sonnes Love fire, ſo that the Fathers anger-fire and the Sonnes Love fire, in the <hi>humane</hi> Subſtance ſtood in one Ground: the Love-fire became Subſtantiall, that is, a heavenly fleſh, and gave it ſelfe to the anger-fire of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the humane <hi>Lifes</hi> property, for food to a fire-burning, after the manner, as a Man putteth a pleaſant Oyly Balſam to a fire, and then the fire in its burning giveth forth out of it ſelfe, a pleaſant ſmell and vertue out of this Balſam Oyle.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thus the Father now <hi>ſmelt this pleaſant ſavour</hi> in the Humanity in the Soules fire, which ſavour he <hi>formerly</hi> ſmelt in the Sacrifice in the Type: for Chriſt was now the right high Prieſt, which offered to God his Father the acceptable Sacrifice of the ſweet ſavour in the Humanity, and reconciled the Anger in the Humanity: The <hi>Altar</hi> of God upon which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſacrificed, was now <hi>in</hi> the Humanity of Chriſt, who offered up to God the ſweet humanity out of the heavenly <hi>Ens,</hi> with the Adamicall humanity into his Anger-fire, which burned in the Adamicall humanity: Sinne in the Adamicall fleſh was deſtroyed through the ſweet heavenly fleſh: viz: through the Subſtantiall Word of Love, through JESUS, viz: Gods greateſt <hi>Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. God brought the Sacrifice of <hi>Moſes,</hi> viz: the reconciliation in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:111822:49"/>fire, into the humanity, and made of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Chriſt; viz: the right high Prieſt, who with his holy bloud beſprinckled the Altar, viz: the fire-<hi>Life;</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> did with the bloud of Beaſts in the <hi>Type.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. And we ſee this Eminently in <hi>the Supper</hi> of Chriſt, which when at laſt he would enter into his ſufferings, and kill ſinne in our huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, with the ſubſtantiall Love fire in his bloud, then at laſt <hi>he Eate the Paſchall Lamb with his Diſciples:</hi> for he had given himſelfe up into the Type with his Grace-Covenant, with the heavenly fleſh, and would fullfill the Type with the fleſh of Love, and bring forth the Adami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call humanity through Death; viz: through Gods Anger, through the incloſure of the Adamicall Life into Gods Love-fire, and <hi>breake open the Priſon of Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. So now in the Type of the Paſchal-Lamb he began the New Teſtament, viz: the <hi>fullfilling</hi> of theſe Types: and lead his Diſciples to the Sacrifice of the New Teſtament; viz: to the Altar of God, in his fleſh and bloud, that they ſhould eate the fullfilling of the Old Teſtament in the Sacrifice of the New Teſtament: for he brought the Old Teſtament, viz: the <hi>figure,</hi> into the New, viz: into his fleſh and bloud, which was <hi>the Sacrifice of reconciliation for the ſinnes of the World;</hi> and gave them the<note n="b" place="margin">

                  <p n="7">7 For the reconcillation ſhould be no more done in fire, where the Fathers anger burnt away the vanity in Mans Faith, but it ſhould be done in the Love-fire, in <hi>the fleſh of Chriſt:</hi> they ſhould now with their faiths deſire, viz: with the fiery lifes Mouth of the ſoule, eate and drink the reconciliation with Chriſts fleſh and bloud: <hi>No more</hi> with Faith in the Type, but in Subſtance, no more in power without Subſtance, but with Subſtantiall Divine and humane power, wherein the <hi>humanity of Chriſt himſelfe</hi> ſhould be the Paſchal Lamb: Not Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without Humanity, but Deity and Humanity alike.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For <hi>the Paſchal-Lamb muſt be eaten quite up,</hi> and ſo alſo he would not give them onely a piece of his humanity, but (Note) gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to them wholly and altogether, into their ſoules fire-mouth, viz: into the Faiths-deſire: The ſoules fiery Mouth was now the fire of God which devoured the Sacrifice: as common fire devoureth Oyle, and giveth a cleere light out of its conſuming: Thus alſo Chriſt gave to his Diſciples, viz: to their faiths <hi>deſire,</hi> underſtand, to the fiery Mouth of the Soule, as to the true Life; his heavenly Body and his heavenly Bloud, in that manner and way, as the heavenly <hi>Ens</hi> in the limit of the Covenant gave it ſelfe, into <hi>Mary,</hi> into the vaniſhed <hi>Ens,</hi> and became one Perſon, wholly undivided.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Note; He gave his <hi>whole</hi> heavenly humanity to them into their Adamicall Humanity, underſtand to the Paradiſicall Ground: for every Life deſireth an <hi>Ens</hi> of its likeneſſe, viz: every fire deſireth
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:111822:50"/>an <hi>Ens</hi> for its burning, which is like that fire.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The fooliſh fire-life was become dark through the Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Death, and therefore needed a light <hi>Ens,</hi> out of the Divine Light, as a Subſtance of Light: as a holy anointing Oyle: wherein the dark painfull Soules fire changeth it ſelfe into a Light- and Love-deſire: This now conceived upon Chriſts <hi>Altar,</hi> viz: out of Chriſts <hi>humanity,</hi> the Subſtantiall Love, viz: the Subſtantiall Wiſdome of God: that ſame fire in this Subſtance was the <hi>Name</hi> and the power JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, viz: Gods greateſt <hi>holineſſe,</hi> which changeth the Soules fire into a Light: whence Chriſt ſaid; <hi>Hee was the Light of the world,</hi> Joh. 8.12. For in his power, hath the Soule againe attained eyes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light, ſo that it beholdeth God againe.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And as a Man giveth Oyle to common fire, out of which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a Light, ſo in like manner is to be underſtood concerning the dark Soules fire; which receiveth into it ſelfe, Chriſts heavenly <hi>Ens</hi> of the Divine Subſtantiall Love, in this Teſtament, and kindleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the vaniſhed even heavenly <hi>Ens</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> and burneth in its likeneſſe: wherein <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> viz: <hi>the City of God</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine unlocked, where the Divine Light in that ſame unlocked Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſicall Ground ſhineth againe: which is the City of God <hi>in Man,</hi> where the Holy Ghoſt dwelleth; of which Chriſt ſaith; <hi>Hee that Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth my fleſh and drinketh my bloud, he continueth in Mee and I in him,</hi> Joh. 6.56.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. In this Paradiſicall unlocked Ground, Chriſt, viz: the Divine Love-<hi>Ens,</hi> continneth dwelling in the Light: for the power in the Light is the Divine <hi>Ens,</hi> viz: the Supernaturall heavenly fleſh, a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Life, which Tincture tinctureth the Soule, and giveth the heavenly fire-Glance to the Soules-fire; But yet that a Man may rightly underſtand it: The Soule is the Fathers fire, which receiveth into it ſelfe (viz: into its fiery deſire) the Sonnes <hi>Subſtantiall</hi> Love, viz: the holy Love-fire, which hath turned it ſelfe into the humane Tincture, viz: into fleſh and bloud, underſtand, into that ſame hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lifes power: Thus is the changing of the Soules Will Effected.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Thus wee ſee firſt this figure in <hi>Moſeſes</hi> Sacrifice of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Soule, viz: the Faiths deſire of the Soule brought it ſelfe into the Sacrifice, as into a <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and with the Subſtance went into the fire, where the reconciliation through fire, was made in the introduced <hi>Covenant</hi> of the Love-fire, in that manner and way, as the Subſtantiall Love of Chriſt ſhould give it ſelfe up into the Soules-fire, wherein Gods anger did burne, for food and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Secondly, wee ſee alſo by <hi>Moſes,</hi> not onely how the Soule is ranſomed from ſinne through fire, and with the Love in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant became fed with the holy fire of Grace, but they <hi>bleſſed alſo the bread and fleſh</hi> through the reconciliation of the Grace-Covenant,

                  <p n="14">14. Which ſignifieth the Orall eating and drinking of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall Grace; where not onely the Soule is fed, but (Note) alſo the right Adamicall Man, <hi>which ſhall ariſe</hi> from Death againe: for the Earth was curſed through Mans ſinne, and Man muſt from the Curſe of Gods anger Eate of the Earthly fruit: but with this Sacrifice and bleſſing of the Covenant, God erecteth now <hi>a new bleſſing,</hi> ſo that <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> did eate of Bleſſed food againe, where the Grace preſſed through the Curſe againe, as the Sunne preſſeth and penetrateth through Water.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. All which was a <hi>Type</hi> of the Teſtament of Chriſt, which would not onely feed the Soule with Subſtantiall fiery Love; But (Note) alſo the right Adamicall <hi>Body:</hi> and that when he would ordaine his New Teſtament under <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> [ſignified] how the inward Grace of Love would preſſe through the outward Man, as the Sunne penetrateth through the Water, or as fire penetrateth through Iron.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And by the Orall eating and drinking of his New Teſtament is ſignified the Paſchal Lamb in the Old Teſtament, where the Grace-Covenant of the Divine bleſſing <hi>gave it ſelfe</hi> into a viſible Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Subſtance, viz: into a <hi>Medium,</hi> wherein the humane Body recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Grace: And it points at the New Teſtament, where Chriſt, viz: the Subſtantiall Grace, would with his Love, with the power of his fleſh and bloud, of Divine and humane property, <hi>give himſelfe</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his fellow-Members the Chriſtians, through an Elementary <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> of bleſſed Bread and Wine for-foode and drink: where-through, the accurſed Body out of the <hi>Limus</hi> of the Earth, (which hath eaten the Curſe into it ſelfe) is bleſſed againe.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. This wee ſee cleerly by the Laſt Supper of Chriſt, that Chriſt with the Inſtitution of the New Teſtament, would <hi>not</hi> ordaine any ſtrange or <hi>new thing,</hi> but onely fullfill the Old Teſtament; and with the Subſtantiall Grace, which in his Soule and fleſh was become MAN; give himſelfe up into the Covenant of the Old Teſtament: and himſelfe be the <hi>fullfilling,</hi> viz: the Paſchal Lamb, and the Holy bread and fleſh, where-through our right Adamicall Man is to be bleſſed: <hi>For he</hi> firſt <hi>eate the Paſchal Lamb with his Diſciples,</hi> and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated himſelfe with them in the Covenant of the Old Teſtament: <hi>and waſhed their feete</hi> for them: Afterwards <hi>he tooke the Bread, gave thanks, and brake it, and gave to them,</hi> and ſayd: <hi>Take and Eate, that is my body, which is given for you: In like manner alſo he tooke the Cup after the Supper and gave thanks, gave to them and ſayd: Drink yee all thereof, that is my bloud of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſinnes: I ſay unto you, I will now henceforth drink no more of this

                  <p n="18">18. This is now the true Ground, and <hi>ſignifieth</hi> firſt how the ſweet Grace of Gods Covenant, hath given it ſelfe up into our humanity: and ſecondly, how that ſame Grace-Covenant, (which in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament with the Sacrifices and Paſchal-Lamb, gave it ſelfe to <hi>Iſrael</hi> under that ſame food for a bleſſing,) doth now with the aſſumed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity give it ſelfe to Man alſo under a <hi>Medium,</hi> viz: under Bread and Wine, to be eaten and drunk: and Thirdly: how he would not take away the firſt Covenant, and begin ſome new thing; but how he <hi>himſelfe</hi> would be that very Grace-Covenant, and now preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as a Man, and now give himſelfe <hi>into</hi> Man after a Divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane way; that as they had participated of him heretofore, with his Grace in the Covenant, in the Sacrifice, in a ſpirituall way <hi>in power,</hi> through a <hi>Medium,</hi> ſo now they ſhould participate of him alſo in a corporeall and ſpirituall way through the <hi>Medium</hi> of Bread &amp; Wine, and Subſtantially participate of that ſame incorporated Grace in the Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. For the cauſe was this; that he would give himſelfe to them to be participated both in a humane and alſo in a Divine <hi>property,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; that they ſhould participate of the Grace (which had given it ſelfe into the humanity, and ſlaine Death, and opened the humane Life againe, and brought it through Death) in a <hi>new humane Life:</hi> that the ſame New Life out of Chriſts Death and Reſurrection, might unlock even their Life which was ſhut up in Death, therefore he gave them this new unlocked humane Life of his aſſumed humane Life, with his fleſh and bloud, even under an <hi>Elementary Medium,</hi> that the Faith might conceive it through a <hi>Medium.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. See a Similitude in the Sunne, which <hi>ſtandeth</hi> in its Orb, but preſſeth with its Luſtre, power, and whole Subſtance, with all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is in Eſſence, power, and Subſtance, forth out of it ſelfe into the <hi>whole world,</hi> and giveth it ſelfe to every Element, Subſtance, and Creature, to all hearbs, and Trees, alſo to every Creaturely life, and worketh in all things, whatſoever it will receive, and yet teareth not it ſelfe, when it goeth forth from it ſelfe, and <hi>giveth it ſelfe</hi> to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, it continueth alwayes whole, and goeth not away from its Subſtance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 So is alſo the Supper of Chriſt to be underſtood; as wee ſee a Similitude of it in the hearbs and graſſe of the Earth, which neither doth, nor can doe any thing <hi>without</hi> the power of the Sunne, it ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Jawes of its Eſſence wide open towards the Sunnes power and vertue; that is, it hungereth onely after that, and into that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Sunne ſhineth in, and kindleth <hi>the Spirit,</hi> viz: the Brimſtone, Salt, and Oyle of the Hearb: and as ſoone as that is done, that the Sunnes vertue findeth or perceiveth it ſelfe in the Brimſtone, Salt and Oyle of the Hearb, then it <hi>worketh</hi> therein, whence the Hearb attaineth a perceptible warmth, and conceiveth and impreſſeth the Sunnes vertue in it ſelfe, ſo that the Sunnes vertue and power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh <hi>Subſtantiall</hi> in the Hearb, and groweth with the Hearb, and tinctureth the ſame, whereby the Hearb becometh Sunney or Solar, and worketh, to [the bringing forth] fruit.</p>

                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="6">6. Note: And thus hath God powred his love through the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Subſtance in the humanity of Chriſt, <hi>into the Diſciples</hi> of Chriſt, with the humane Subſtance; in that way and manner, as the Sunnes power and vertue <hi>in Spiritu Mundi,</hi> in the Spirit of the World; as with the Effluence of the power and vertue of the Starres, mingleth it ſelfe with the <hi>Spirituall</hi> Brimſtone, Salt and Oyle in the upper E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, ſo that it comprehendeth their power and vertue in its Glance, and giveth it ſelfe to them, and it (the power) giveth it ſelfe into the Sunnes power and vertue, and [ſo they] worke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby <hi>the light of Nature</hi> is unlocked, and with ſuch working give themſelves into the Earth, Hearbs, Trees, and all Creatures: ſo that in an Heath or Tree ſuch a <hi>vertue</hi> doth exiſt; whence the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration or budding forth of Creatures doth exiſt: where alwayes in ſuch growing or life, a man is to underſtand (1) an Elementary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall power and vertue, and then (2) a ſuper-Elementary Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or Solar and Starry or Aſtrall power and vertue, where the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="28">28.

                  <p n="30">30. Wee are Members of Chriſt according to his humanity, and are therefore called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe Chriſt dwelleth and worketh in us, in that wee are in our Life his twiggs and branches, in thoſe in whom he bringeth forth fruit through his power and vertue: O little Children, it is a Great Myſterie! Note, Note; the <hi>uſe</hi> of this Teſtament, where wee eſpecially under Bread and Wine ſhould partake of Chriſts fleſh and bloud; is <hi>therefore</hi> ordained, that ſo wee ſhould come together, and eate of One Bread, drink of One Cup, and thereunder receive Chriſt, that wee ſhould <hi>Inſtruct</hi> one another, what he hath done for us, and declare his ſuffering Death and bloud-ſhedding one <hi>among</hi> another, and <hi>teach it to our children,</hi> and ſhould <hi>binde</hi> our ſelves therewith in Love, and exhort one another, that wee in Chriſt are Members of one Body, that wee in Chriſt are all but One.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. Even as the One onely Chriſt giveth himſelfe into us <hi>all</hi> in <hi>Common</hi> to be one onely Life, and loveth us all in his one onely Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and reacheth forth that ſame onely humanity with his great Love and Grace to us all in Common, under one Bread and Wine, and ſo bindeth himſelfe to us in one only participation: Thus ſhould wee alſo in <hi>ſuch coming together</hi> and participation, as members of one body, <hi>binde</hi> our ſelves together <hi>in true Love</hi> and faithfulneſſe, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly Conſider, that in ſuch participation wee are all but one in Chriſt: for wee partake all of one onely Chriſt, and in that ſame one Chriſt wee are one onely Body, which is Chriſt in his Members: O little Children, what a depth of Myſterie is this if wee did rightly conſider it!

                  <p n="32">32. Therefore wee ſhould rightly conſider this, and not with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy hearts and Mouths draw neere to this <hi>Communion,</hi> and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is enough, that wee partake of Bread and Wine: No, it is a brotherly, memberly <hi>Band</hi> and Covenant; wee binde our ſelves therewith in Chriſt to be one onely Man, and that ſame one onely Man, is every one himſelfe in Chriſt: therefore our purpoſe in ſuch coming together ſhould be, that wee as Members of one Body, will <hi>binde</hi> our ſelves faſt with ſuch participation, and forſake Satan with
